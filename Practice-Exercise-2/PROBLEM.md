**Exercise 2: Problem Statement**


In “Phoenix Corporation” David and Richard both are members of the sales group. In the directory, /home/david/data both users have the same permissions which is to read, write, and execute. ​

​

Both users have the same permission and because of this they can see and modify each other’s data easily.​

​

How can you grant permissions in a manner that allows only the owner of the files to make modifications?

Add two users, “David” and ”Richard” to this group​

Create a directory for “data” in the /home/david.​

Make “sales” the group owner in /home/david/data directory.​

Provide read, write, and execute permissions to sales group ​

Enable Sticky bit on the folder to prevent the issue.​
