**Exercise 3: Problem Statement**

In Phoenix Corp, Andrew and Sophia works in the sales department.  As a system admin, you have been asked to create a sales directory for this department. ​

​

The system administrator has given the read, write, and execute permissions and given group ownership to the sales department. andrew has recently created a file named. “andrew112”. Now, the group ownership of the file has changed to andrew. This has been done because the admin wants group ownership of each file created under the directory to be given only to the “sales” group. ​


How can you help organization change the owner of ​the file?​

Create two users with the name of Andrew and Sophia​

Create the sales directory in /home​

Create a group with the name of “sales”.​

Provide read, write, and execute permission over the directory /home/sales to sales group.​

Enable the SGID bit over the directory.​
